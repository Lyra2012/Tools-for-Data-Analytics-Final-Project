# # Tools For Data Science Final Project

# #### This is an introduction to the final project for the second module of the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

# ##### Some of the Most Popular Data Science Languages include: 
# 1. Python
# 2. R 
# 3. SQL
# 4. JavaScript
# 5. Java
# 6. C/C++
# 7. MATLAB
# 8. Scala
# 9. Julia
# 10. SAS

# ##### Some of the Most Popular Data Science Libraries include:
# 1. Numpy for scientific computing and performing basic and advanced array operations
# 2. SciPy for scientific programming projects and great for numerical routines such as numerical optimizations, integrations, and others in submodules
# 3. Pandas for work with labeled or relational data  and allows for the converting of data structures into DataFrame objects, handling missing data, adding/deleting objects from the DataFrame, imputing missing files, and plotting data
# 4. Keras for building neural networks and modeling
# 5. Sci-Kit Learn for Data Science projects based in Python
# 6. PyTorch for data scientists who want to perform deep learning tasks
# 7. TensorFlow for machine learning and deep learning
# 8. Matplotlib for for generating data visualizations of two-dimensional diagrams and graphs
# 9. Scrapy for building crawling programs that retrieve structured data from the web
